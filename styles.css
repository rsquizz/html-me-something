/*Use margin and padding to space your elements in a visually pleasing way.
Use at least one of each of the following types of selectors: element, class, id.
Don't break these rules:
At all costs, avoid adding HTML elements in order to achieve a specific visual effect.
Use document-level and inline styles sparingly, and only when absolutely necessary.

In order to see any visible change, make sure to link the stylesheet to your main document. */
